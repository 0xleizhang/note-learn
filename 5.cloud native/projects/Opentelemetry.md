>OpenTelemetry (or “OTel”) is a collection of open-source tools, APIs, and SDKs to generate, collect, and export telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. It integrates with a wide variety of libraries and frameworks in various languages, many of which include automatic instrumentation out-of-the-box. As an open source and vendor-neutral project, OTel allows you to send that data to multiple backends and avoid vendor lock-in.
